# Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge – Day 05  
## Topic: Delta Lake (Advanced)

This repository contains my work and learnings from **Day 05** of the **Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge** organized by **Indian Data Club (IDC)**.

---

## 📌 What I Learned & Implemented

### 1️⃣ Incremental MERGE (Upsert Operations)
- Implemented **incremental MERGE** to update existing records and insert new records into Delta tables.
- Avoided full table reloads, making the data pipeline more efficient.

**Benefit:** Improves performance and reduces compute cost.

---

### 2️⃣ Querying Historical Versions (Time Travel)
- Used **Delta Lake Time Travel** to query previous versions of a table.
- Enabled access to data using version numbers and timestamps.

**Benefit:** Useful for auditing, debugging, and data recovery.

---

### 3️⃣ Optimizing Delta Tables
- Applied optimization techniques to reduce small files.
- Improved data layout for faster query execution.

**Benefit:** Enhances query performance and resource utilization.

---

### 4️⃣ Cleaning Old Files
- Removed unused and outdated files from Delta tables.
- Managed storage effectively.

**Benefit:** Keeps the data lake clean and cost-efficient.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
Delta Lake provides:
- ACID transactions  
- Data versioning  
- High performance  
- Reliability for production-grade data pipelines  

This challenge helped me gain hands-on experience with **advanced Delta Lake features used in real-world data engineering workflows**.
