## 🚀 Day 11 – Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge

### 📊 Topic: Statistical Analysis & ML Preparation

Day 11 focused on strengthening the statistical foundation required for building reliable machine learning models using Databricks.

### 🔍 What I worked on:
- Calculated **statistical summaries** to understand data distribution  
- Performed **hypothesis testing** (Weekday vs Weekend comparison)  
- Identified **correlations** between important variables  
- Applied **feature engineering techniques** to prepare data for ML  

### 💡 Key Takeaway:
Strong machine learning models begin with **deep statistical understanding** and **well-engineered features**.  
This step bridges the gap between raw data and effective ML pipelines.

### 🛠️ Tools & Concepts:
- Databricks
- Statistical Analysis
- Hypothesis Testing
- Correlation Analysis
- Feature Engineering

📈 Progressing step by step towards building production-ready AI & data solutions.
