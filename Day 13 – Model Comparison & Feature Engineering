# Day 13 – Model Comparison & Feature Engineering  
**Databricks 14-Days AI Challenge**

## 📌 Topic
Model Comparison and Feature Engineering

---

## 🎯 Challenge Objectives
- Train **3 different machine learning models**
- Compare evaluation metrics using **MLflow**
- Build a **Spark-based ML workflow**
- Select the best-performing model based on metrics

---

## 📊 Dataset
Source: Spark table `Copy_of_movies`

### Selected Features
- `Release_year`
- `Budget`
- `Revenue`

### Target
- `Imdb_rating`

Only numeric columns were used, and null values were removed before training.

---

## ⚙️ Models Trained
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  

---

## 🧪 Experiment Tracking
All experiments were tracked using **MLflow**, including:
- Model parameters  
- R² evaluation metric  
- Trained model artifacts  

Each model run was logged under a single MLflow experiment for comparison.

---

## 📈 Results (R² Score)

| Model            | R² Score |
|------------------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 0.0527 |
| Decision Tree     | **0.2076** |
| Random Forest     | 0.1298 |

✅ **Decision Tree Regressor** performed better compared to other models for this dataset.

---

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Model performance depends heavily on **feature quality**, not just algorithm choice  
- MLflow simplifies **experiment tracking and model comparison**  
- Low R² scores highlight the need for **better feature engineering and data enrichment**  
- Transparent evaluation helps guide iterative model improvement
