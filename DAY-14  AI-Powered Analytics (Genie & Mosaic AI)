# Day 14 – AI-Powered Analytics (Genie & Mosaic AI)

## 📌 Overview
On Day 14 of the **Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge**, I explored **AI-Powered Analytics** using **Databricks Genie** and **Mosaic AI**.  
The focus was on natural language querying, AI-assisted insights, and experiment tracking using MLflow.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Used
**Table:** `copy_of_movies`

Key columns:
- `title`
- `industry`
- `imdb_rating`
- `revenue`
- `budget`

---

## 🔹 1. Natural Language Analytics with Databricks Genie
Using **Databricks Genie**, I queried the dataset using plain English questions such as:
- *Show top 10 movies by revenue*
- *What is the average IMDb rating by industry?*

### Outcome:
- Genie automatically generated SQL queries
- Results were displayed as tables and charts
- Enabled faster analytics without writing manual SQL

---

## 🔹 2. AI-Powered Insight
Based on the Genie-generated analysis, the following insight was derived:

> Certain movie industries consistently achieve higher IMDb ratings, while higher revenue does not always correlate with better ratings, indicating that commercial success and audience appreciation do not always align.

This demonstrates how **AI-assisted analytics** can uncover meaningful patterns from data.

---

## 🔹 3. Simple NLP with Mosaic AI (MLflow)
To demonstrate AI capabilities on textual data, I performed **sentiment analysis** on movie titles using a pre-trained Transformer model and tracked the experiment using **MLflow** as part of Mosaic AI.

### Code Snippet:
```python
import mlflow
from transformers import pipeline

movies_df = spark.table("copy_of_movies")

titles = (
    movies_df
    .select("title")
    .dropna()
    .limit(5)
    .rdd
    .map(lambda r: r[0])
    .collect()
)

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
sentiment_results = classifier(titles)

with mlflow.start_run(run_name="movie_title_sentiment"):
    mlflow.log_param("model", "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
    mlflow.log_param("text_source", "copy_of_movies.title")
    mlflow.log_metric("sample_size", len(titles))
