## What I Learnt
- Track ML experiments in Databricks using MLflow
- Difference between **metrics**, **parameters**, and **artifacts**
- How to log a **trained model** for reproducibility
- Compare multiple runs to evaluate model performance

## What I Did
- Created an MLflow experiment: `price_prediction_v1`
- Trained a **Linear Regression model**
- Logged **parameters** (`model_type`, `test_size`) and **metrics** (`r2_score`)
- Saved the **model as an artifact**
- Ran **multiple experiments** and used **Compare Runs** to find the best model

## Key Takeaway
MLflow makes **experiment tracking, model reproducibility, and comparison** easy, which is essential for professional ML workflows.
