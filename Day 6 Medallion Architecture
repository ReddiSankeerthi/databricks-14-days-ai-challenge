# Databricks Medallion Architecture

## Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge – Day 06

---

## About the Project
This project is part of the **Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge** by **Indian Data Club** and **Codebasics**.  
It demonstrates the implementation of **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)** using **Databricks and PySpark**.

The project shows how raw data is processed step by step to create clean, analytics-ready data.

---

## Objective
To design and implement a layered data pipeline that transforms raw data into meaningful business insights using Medallion Architecture.

---

## Architecture / Approach
The project follows **Medallion Architecture**:

- **Bronze Layer** – Raw data ingestion  
- **Silver Layer** – Data cleaning and validation  
- **Gold Layer** – Business-level aggregations  

Each layer is stored as a **Delta table**.

---

## Implementation

### Bronze Layer
- Ingested raw CSV data
- Used schema inference and headers
- Added ingestion timestamp
- Stored raw data without transformations

### Silver Layer
- Removed duplicate records
- Filtered invalid values (null or negative prices)
- Trimmed important columns (`product_id`, `user_id`)
- Stored cleaned data as Delta table

### Gold Layer
- Aggregated data by `product_id` and `category_id`
- Calculated:
  - Total views
  - Total purchases
  - Total revenue
  - Conversion rate
- Stored analytics-ready data as Delta table

---

## Technologies Used
- Databricks (Free Edition)
- PySpark
- Delta Lake

---

## Key Learnings
- Understanding Medallion Architecture in practice
- How data flows from Bronze → Silver → Gold
- Importance of data quality and layered design
- Hands-on experience with Databricks and PySpark

---

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand real-world data pipeline design and strengthened my foundation in data engineering and analytics concepts.
