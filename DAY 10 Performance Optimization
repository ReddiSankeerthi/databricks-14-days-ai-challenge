## 📅 Day 10 – Performance Optimization  
### Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge

Today's focus was on optimizing **Spark & Delta Lake performance**, with a deep dive into how real-world data engineering systems are tuned for efficiency.

---

## 🔧 What I Worked On

- Analyzed Spark query execution plans using `EXPLAIN`
- Implemented partitioning strategies by deriving `event_date` from timestamp columns
- Optimized Delta tables using:
  - `OPTIMIZE`
  - `ZORDER`
- Benchmarked query performance before and after optimization
- Learned about **Serverless compute limitations**, where in-memory caching is not supported, and how storage-level optimizations compensate for it

---

## 📌 Key Learnings

- Partition pruning significantly reduces data scanned
- ZORDER improves selective query performance through data skipping
- Choosing the right partition column (**DATE vs TIMESTAMP**) is critical
- Performance tuning depends on the compute type (**Serverless vs All-Purpose**)

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

> Performance optimization is not just about query logic —  
> data layout and storage design play a major role.
